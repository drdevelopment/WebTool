# Welcome to WebTool
WebTool is another tool to setup and edit your website (in only 5 minutes). This is one of the goals of this project. The other goal is to create a Core which can be used to create micro-services. Due to its pluggable components it is easy to extend.
The core is also an integration of several powerfull Java frameworks, like **Jetty**, **Angular**, **RestEasy**, **Jackson**, **H2**, **JDbi**, **Appache Commons** and security (JAAS). When I start to create a new web-application, it always costs me a lot of time to find and integrate these frameworks.

This is also free-of-anything and is delivered with the **MIT-license**. Hopefully, you will enjoy WebTool and if you are interested, help me to improve it! Please, click :star: (on top of the screen) to star the project or fork this project.
